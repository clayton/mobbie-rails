### Running Tests

To run all tests:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/models/mobbie/purchase_spec.rb spec/models/mobbie/subscription_spec.rb spec/models/mobbie/user_simple_spec.rb spec/services/mobbie/apple_iap_service_spec.rb -fd
```

To run individual test files:
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/models/mobbie/subscription_spec.rb -fd
bundle exec rspec spec/services/mobbie/apple_iap_service_spec.rb -fd
```

### Test Infrastructure

- **RSpec** for testing framework
- **FactoryBot** for test data generation
- **Shoulda Matchers** for Rails-specific matchers
- **WebMock** for external API mocking
- **Timecop** for time-based testing

### Notes

- Tests use a simplified spec helper (`simple_spec_helper.rb`) that creates a minimal Rails environment
- Database is cleaned between each test for isolation
- Apple IAP API calls are mocked to avoid external dependencies
- JWT tokens are generated with test secrets for authentication testing
